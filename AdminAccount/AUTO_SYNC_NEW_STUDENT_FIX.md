# Auto-Sync Fix for New Student Documents
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** Auto-sync was not syncing newly added students and their documents to Google Drive  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

When adding a new student with documents through:
- `newstudent.php` (Regular students)
- `transferee.php` (Transferee students)

The auto-sync feature was **NOT** being triggered, even when:
- Auto-sync was enabled
- Google Drive was connected
- Documents were successfully uploaded

**Result:** New students and their files were not appearing in Google Drive until documents were modified through the "lacking of documents" feature.

---

## Root Cause

The document upload handlers in `newstudent.php` and `transferee.php` were missing the call to trigger the auto-sync processor after successfully uploading documents.

The auto-sync was only being triggered from:
- `lackingofdoc_logic.php` (when updating existing documents)
- Manual backup operations

---

## Solution Applied

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `AdminAccount/newstudent.php`
**Changes:**
- Added: `require_once __DIR__ . '/../includes/trigger_auto_sync.php';` (line ~33)
- Added: `triggerAutoSyncNow($studentDbId, $documentId);` after each document is successfully uploaded (inside document processing loop)

#### 2. `AdminAccount/transferee.php`
**Changes:**
- Added: `require_once __DIR__ . '/../includes/trigger_auto_sync.php';` (line ~33)
- Added: `triggerAutoSyncNow($studentDbId, $documentId);` after each document is successfully uploaded (inside document processing loop)

## How It Works Now

### When a new student is registered:

1. **Student record created** → Database insert
2. **Each document uploaded** → File saved + Database record created
3. **Auto-sync triggered** → `triggerAutoSyncNow($studentDbId, $documentId)` called
4. **Auto-sync checks:**
   - Is auto-sync enabled? ✓
   - Is Google Drive connected? ✓
5. **Background sync initiated** → Async call to `auto_sync_processor.php`
6. **Auto-sync processor runs:**
   - Creates/finds main backup folder: `IBACMI Backup [School Year]`
   - Creates/finds student folder: `[LastName], [FirstName] [StudentID]`
   - Uploads document to Google Drive
   - Records in `backup_manifest` table

## Benefits

✅ **Immediate syncing** - Documents appear in Google Drive right after upload  
✅ **No manual intervention** - Staff/admin don't need to run backup manually  
✅ **Consistent behavior** - Works for both new students AND document updates  
✅ **No duplicates** - Auto-sync processor has built-in duplicate detection  
✅ **Audit trail** - All syncs recorded in `backup_logs` and `backup_manifest` tables

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Enable auto-sync in backup settings
- [x] Connect Google Drive
- [x] Add a new regular student with documents
- [x] Verify documents appear in Google Drive under correct folder structure
- [x] Add a new transferee student with documents
- [x] Verify documents appear in Google Drive under correct folder structure
- [x] Check `backup_logs` table for successful sync entries
- [x] Check `backup_manifest` table for document records
- [x] Verify no duplicate uploads occur on subsequent runs

## Database Tables Involved

- `system_settings` - Auto-sync status and Google Drive tokens
- `backup_logs` - Backup operation logs
- `backup_manifest` - Document-level sync tracking
- `student_documents` - Document metadata
- `students` - Student information

## Notes

- Auto-sync runs asynchronously (non-blocking) via CURL with 1-second timeout
- Documents are synced individually as they're uploaded (not in batch)
- Duplicate detection prevents re-uploading unchanged files
- System maintains folder structure: `IBACMI Backup [Year]/[Student Name]/[Documents]`
