# âœ… AUTO-SYNC FIX - COMPLETE

## Problem
Auto-sync was not triggering when documents were uploaded/submitted. It only worked when manual backup was performed.

## Root Cause
The auto-sync system was not being triggered after document uploads in the following files:
1. **newstudent.php** - No auto-sync trigger after document insertion
2. **transferee.php** - Had trigger call but function didn't exist
3. **upload_handler.php** - No auto-sync trigger after document update

## Solution Applied

### 1. **newstudent.php** - Added Auto-Sync Trigger
**Location:** After line 378 (after document insertion)

**Added:**
```php
// âœ… TRIGGER AUTO-SYNC after document insertion
$checkSyncSql = "SELECT setting_value FROM system_settings WHERE setting_name = 'auto_sync_status'";
$syncResult = $conn->query($checkSyncSql);

if ($syncResult && $syncResult->num_rows > 0) {
    $syncRow = $syncResult->fetch_assoc();
    if ($syncRow['setting_value'] === 'enabled') {
        // Call auto_sync_processor.php asynchronously
        // ... trigger code ...
    }
}
```

**What it does:**
- Checks if auto-sync is enabled
- Triggers auto_sync_processor.php via CURL (asynchronous)
- Passes student_id and document_id
- Uses fire-and-forget approach (500ms timeout)

### 2. **transferee.php** - Added Missing Function
**Location:** After line 29 (after database connection)

**Added:**
```php
/**
 * âœ… Trigger auto-sync for newly uploaded document
 */
function triggerAutoSyncNow($studentId, $documentId) {
    global $conn;
    
    // Check if auto-sync is enabled
    // Call auto_sync_processor.php asynchronously
    // ... same logic as newstudent.php ...
}
```

**What it does:**
- Implements the missing `triggerAutoSyncNow()` function
- Same logic as newstudent.php for consistency
- Called at line 382 after document insertion

### 3. **upload_handler.php** - Added Auto-Sync Trigger
**Location:** In `handleDocumentUpload()` function, after document update

**Added:**
```php
// Get the document ID that was just updated
$getDocIdSql = "SELECT id FROM student_documents WHERE student_id = ? AND document_type_id = ?";
// ... get document ID ...

// âœ… TRIGGER AUTO-SYNC if enabled
if ($result && $documentId) {
    // Check if auto-sync is enabled
    // Call auto_sync_processor.php asynchronously
    // ... trigger code ...
}
```

**What it does:**
- Retrieves the document ID after update
- Checks if auto-sync is enabled
- Triggers auto_sync_processor.php asynchronously

## How It Works Now

### Document Upload Flow:
1. **User uploads document** (via newstudent.php, transferee.php, or lackingofdoc.php)
2. **Document saved to database** with `is_submitted = 1`
3. **Auto-sync check** happens immediately:
   - Checks if auto-sync is enabled in system_settings
   - If enabled, triggers auto_sync_processor.php
4. **Auto-sync processor runs**:
   - Gets all submitted documents for all students
   - Creates/finds "IBACMI Backup {school_year}" folder
   - Creates/finds student folder (format: "LastName, FirstName StudentID")
   - Uploads new documents to Google Drive
   - Updates existing documents if changed
   - Skips unchanged documents
   - Records in backup_manifest table

### Key Features:
âœ… **Instant sync** - Happens immediately after document submission
âœ… **Asynchronous** - Doesn't slow down the upload process
âœ… **Duplicate prevention** - Checks existing files before uploading
âœ… **Change detection** - Only updates files that changed
âœ… **Folder reuse** - Uses existing folders from manifest
âœ… **Error handling** - Logs errors without breaking the upload

## Files Modified
1. âœ… `newstudent.php` - Added auto-sync trigger after document insertion
2. âœ… `transferee.php` - Added missing `triggerAutoSyncNow()` function
3. âœ… `upload_handler.php` - Added auto-sync trigger after document update

## Files NOT Modified
- âœ… `lackingofdoc_logic.php` - Already has `triggerAutoSyncForDocument()` working correctly
- âœ… `auto_sync_processor.php` - Already working correctly
- âœ… `backup.php` - No changes needed

## Testing Steps

### 1. Enable Auto-Sync
1. Go to backup page
2. Connect to Google Drive if not connected
3. Click "Enable Auto-Sync"
4. Verify status shows "Enabled"

### 2. Test Document Upload
1. Go to "New Student" or "Transferee" page
2. Fill student details
3. Upload at least one document
4. Submit the form
5. **Expected:** Auto-sync triggers automatically

### 3. Verify Upload
1. Check Google Drive
2. Should see: "IBACMI Backup 2025-2026" folder (or current school year)
3. Inside: Student folder (format: "LastName, FirstName StudentID")
4. Inside student folder: Uploaded documents

### 4. Check Logs
- Check `auto_sync_errors.log` for any issues
- Check `debug.log` for trigger confirmations
- Should see: "ðŸš€ Triggering auto-sync for student X, document Y"
- Should see: "âœ… Auto-sync triggered successfully"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Auto-sync not triggering
**Check:**
1. Is auto-sync enabled? (Check backup page)
2. Is Google Drive connected? (Check connection status)
3. Check `auto_sync_errors.log` for errors
4. Check `debug.log` for trigger messages

### Issue: Documents not appearing in Google Drive
**Check:**
1. Verify auto_sync_processor.php is accessible
2. Check backup_manifest table for records
3. Check Google Drive access token validity
4. Review auto_sync_errors.log for upload errors

### Issue: Duplicate folders created
**Should not happen** - Fix includes folder reuse from manifest
If it does:
1. Check backup_manifest table
2. Verify getStudentFolderFromManifest() is working
3. Check folder name format consistency

## Summary
âœ… Auto-sync now triggers automatically when documents are uploaded
âœ… Works for all document upload methods (new student, transferee, lacking docs)
âœ… Asynchronous execution doesn't slow down uploads
âœ… Proper error handling and logging
âœ… No duplicate folders or files
âœ… Consistent folder naming across all methods
