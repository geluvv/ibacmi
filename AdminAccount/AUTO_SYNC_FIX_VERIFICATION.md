## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Before Testing
1. Ensure auto-sync is **enabled** in the backup settings
2. Ensure Google Drive is **connected**
3. Have a test student with at least one document already uploaded

### Test Case 1: Update Existing Document
```
1. Go to "Lacking of Documents" page
2. Find a student who already has documents
3. Click "Update" button
4. Upload a new version of an existing document
5. Wait for auto-sync to complete
6. Check Google Drive:
   ✅ Should see ONLY ONE folder for the student
   ✅ Folder name format should be "LastName, FirstName StudentID"
   ✅ Updated document should be in the SAME folder
   ❌ Should NOT see duplicate folders
```

### Test Case 2: Multiple Updates
```
1. Update the same document again (different file)
2. Check Google Drive:
   ✅ Still only ONE folder for the student
   ✅ Document is updated in the same location
   ❌ No new folders created
```

### Test Case 3: New Document to Existing Student
```
1. Upload a different document type for the same student
2. Check Google Drive:
   ✅ Still using the SAME student folder
   ✅ New document appears alongside existing documents
   ❌ No duplicate folders
```

### Test Case 4: Check Logs
```
1. Open: c:\xampp\htdocs\ibacmi\AdminAccount\backup_errors.log
   or c:\xampp\htdocs\ibacmi\AdminAccount\auto_sync_errors.log
   
2. Look for log entries like:
   ✅ "Reusing existing student folder from manifest: LastName, FirstName StudentID"
   ✅ "✅ Reusing existing student folder from manifest"
   
3. Should NOT see:
   ❌ "Created new student folder" for students that already exist
```

## 🔍 What to Look For in Google Drive

### CORRECT Structure (After Fix):
```
📁 IBACMI Backup 2024-2025/
  ├── 📁 Dela Cruz, Juan 2024-00123/
  │   ├── 📄 Card 138.pdf
  │   ├── 📄 Certificate of Good Moral.pdf
  │   ├── 📄 PSA Birth Certificate.pdf
  │   └── 📄 2x2 Picture.jpg
  └── 📁 Santos, Maria 2024-00124/
      ├── 📄 Card 138.pdf
      └── 📄 Certificate of Good Moral.pdf
```

### INCORRECT Structure (Before Fix - SHOULD NOT HAPPEN):
```
📁 IBACMI Backup 2024-2025/
  ├── 📁 Dela Cruz, Juan 2024-00123/          ← Original folder
  │   ├── 📄 Card 138.pdf
  │   └── 📄 Certificate of Good Moral.pdf
  ├── 📁 Dela Cruz_Juan_2024-00123/           ← ❌ DUPLICATE! (Old format)
  │   └── 📄 PSA Birth Certificate.pdf        ← Only updated doc
  └── 📁 Dela Cruz, Juan 2024-00123 (1)/      ← ❌ ANOTHER DUPLICATE!
      └── 📄 2x2 Picture.jpg
```

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Check These:

1. **Database Table Exists**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM backup_manifest LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - Should have records with `google_drive_folder_id` values

2. **Function Exists**
   - Verify `getStudentFolderFromManifest()` exists in `backup.php`
   - Verify it's accessible from `lackingofdoc_logic.php`

3. **Token Valid**
   ```sql
   SELECT setting_name, LEFT(setting_value, 20) as token_preview 
   FROM system_settings 
   WHERE setting_name LIKE 'google_drive%';
   ```
   - Should see `google_drive_access_token` with a value

4. **Auto-Sync Enabled**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM system_settings WHERE setting_name = 'auto_sync_status';
   ```
   - Should return `enabled`

## 📊 Success Criteria

✅ **PASS**: Only one folder per student in Google Drive
✅ **PASS**: Updated documents appear in existing folder
✅ **PASS**: Folder names use format: "LastName, FirstName StudentID"
✅ **PASS**: Logs show "Reusing existing student folder from manifest"
✅ **PASS**: No duplicate folders created on subsequent updates

❌ **FAIL**: Multiple folders for same student
❌ **FAIL**: New folders created on each update
❌ **FAIL**: Folders using underscore format (LastName_FirstName_StudentID)
