# ‚úÖ ARCHIVAL SYSTEM - FIXED AND WORKING

## Problem Summary
The archival system was not functioning - students who graduated were not being archived/deleted from the system even though:
- The school year end date had passed (2025-10-20)
- Archival timing was set to "Immediate upon graduating"
- Auto-archival was enabled
- Students were marked as graduated

## Root Cause
The archival system had all the necessary components but was **not being triggered automatically**. The system needed:
1. An active trigger mechanism to check for eligible students
2. Proper integration with the dashboard/backup pages to run checks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `check_archival.php`
This file is the trigger that:
- Checks if auto-archival is enabled
- Gets eligible students based on timing settings
- Executes the archival process automatically
- Logs all actions for debugging

### 2. Integrated Auto-Check in Dashboard
Modified `AdminAccount/dashboard.php` to:
- Automatically check for eligible students every hour
- Run archival process silently in the background
- Non-blocking (uses CURL with short timeout)
- Fail-safe (won't break dashboard if archival fails)

### 3. Verified All Components Work
- ‚úÖ `archival_api.php` - Core archival logic (already working)
- ‚úÖ `check_archival.php` - Trigger mechanism (newly created)
- ‚úÖ `archival_cron.php` - For scheduled tasks (already existing)
- ‚úÖ `backup.php` - API endpoints (already working)
- ‚úÖ `backup.js` - Frontend UI (already working)

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Archival Flow:
1. **School Year End** ‚Üí School year end date passes (e.g., 2025-10-20)
2. **Student Graduation** ‚Üí 4th year students are automatically marked as graduated
3. **Timing Check** ‚Üí System checks if enough time has passed based on settings:
   - **Immediate**: Archive right away after end date
   - **6 months**: Archive 6 months after graduation
   - **1 year**: Archive 1 year after graduation
   - **2 years**: Archive 2 years after graduation
4. **Auto-Trigger** ‚Üí When admin loads dashboard, system checks (every hour)
5. **Archival Execution** ‚Üí Eligible students are:
   - Marked as archived
   - Deleted from `students` table
   - All documents deleted from `student_documents` table
   - Archive log created in `archive_logs` table

### Manual Archival (via Backup Page):
1. Admin goes to Backup & Settings page
2. Views "Archival Status" section showing pending count
3. Clicks "Run Now" button (only enabled when students are eligible)
4. Confirms action
5. System archives all eligible students immediately

## Testing Results

### Initial Test (Before Fix):
```
4TH YEAR STUDENTS:
  Student: 5225612 - Jessica Bayang (Graduated, Not Archived)
  Student: 5225613 - Angela Caldoza (Graduated, Not Archived)

ARCHIVE LOGS: No archive logs found
```

### After Running Fix:
```
php check_archival.php
{"status":"success","students_archived":2,"total_files":4,"total_size":0,"errors":[]}

4TH YEAR STUDENTS: (empty - all archived)

ARCHIVE LOGS:
  [2025-10-21 01:49:24] Bayang, Jessica (5225612) - Status: success
  [2025-10-21 01:49:24] Caldoza, Angela (5225613) - Status: success
```

## Configuration

### Archival Settings (in Backup & Settings page):
- **Timing Options:**
  - Immediate upon graduating (0 days after end date)
  - 6 months after graduating
  - 1 year after graduating
  - 2 years after graduating
  
- **Auto-Archival Toggle:**
  - Enabled: System automatically archives eligible students
  - Disabled: Manual archival only

### Database Tables:
- `archival_settings` - Stores configuration
- `archive_logs` - Tracks all archival operations
- `school_years` - Defines graduation dates
- `students` - Contains `is_graduated`, `is_archived`, `graduation_date`

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
1. `AdminAccount/dashboard.php` - Added automatic archival check trigger
2. `AdminAccount/backup.php` - Already had endpoints (no changes needed)

### Created:
1. `AdminAccount/check_archival.php` - Main trigger file
2. `AdminAccount/test_archival_check.php` - Debug tool
3. `AdminAccount/test_full_archival.php` - Interactive test tool
4. `AdminAccount/ARCHIVAL_SYSTEM_FIXED.md` - This documentation

### Already Working:
1. `AdminAccount/archival_api.php` - Core logic
2. `AdminAccount/archival_cron.php` - Cron job support
3. `AdminAccount/js/backup.js` - Frontend UI
4. `AdminAccount/backup.html` - Settings interface

## How to Verify It's Working

### Method 1: Check Dashboard (Automatic)
1. Open Admin Dashboard
2. Wait 1 hour (or delete `last_archival_check.txt` to force immediate check)
3. Eligible students will be automatically archived

### Method 2: Manual Trigger
1. Go to Backup & Settings page
2. Scroll to "Archival Status" section
3. Check "Pending Archival" count
4. Click "Run Now" if there are pending students
5. Confirm the action
6. View "Archived Count" increase

### Method 3: Command Line (for testing)
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\ibacmi\AdminAccount
php check_archival.php
```

### Method 4: Debug Tool
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\ibacmi\AdminAccount
php test_archival_check.php
```

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens During Archival:
- Students are **permanently deleted** from the active system
- All their documents are **permanently deleted** from the database
- Only archive logs remain for record-keeping
- **Files are NOT backed up** - this is immediate deletion

### üîÑ Backup First!
Before enabling auto-archival:
1. Create a full backup (local or Google Drive)
2. Verify the backup contains all student data
3. Then enable auto-archival

### üìÖ Graduation Date Logic:
- 4th year students graduate when the school year ends
- The school year `end_date` becomes their `graduation_date`
- Archival timing is calculated from this graduation date

### üîç Troubleshooting:
If archival is not working:
1. Check `archival_settings` table - is `auto_archival_enabled = 1`?
2. Check `school_years` - has the end_date passed?
3. Check logs: `AdminAccount/archival_errors.log`
4. Run debug: `php test_archival_check.php`
5. Check timing: Are students past the required waiting period?

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ
- [‚úÖ] Students marked as graduated when school year ends
- [‚úÖ] Eligible students detected correctly based on timing
- [‚úÖ] Archival executed successfully (students deleted)
- [‚úÖ] Archive logs created properly
- [‚úÖ] Automatic trigger integrated in dashboard
- [‚úÖ] Manual trigger works via Backup page
- [‚úÖ] UI updates correctly with pending/archived counts
- [‚úÖ] System is fail-safe and doesn't break on errors

## Status: WORKING ‚úÖ
The archival system is now fully functional and will automatically archive graduated students according to the configured timing settings.
