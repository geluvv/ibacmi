# Archival Fix Summary - Graduation Date Issue

## Problem
- School year 2025-2026 ended on Oct 19, 2025
- Two 4th year students should have been archived with "immediately upon graduation" timing
- Students were NOT being archived because their `graduation_date` field was `NULL`
- The archival system requires a valid `graduation_date` to determine eligibility

## Root Cause
The `auto_advance_processor.php` file did not set the `graduation_date` field when the school year ended. It only changed student status to 'graduated' but didn't record WHEN they graduated.

## Solution Applied
Made minimal targeted changes to 2 files only:

### 1. Fixed `auto_advance_processor.php`
**What was added:**
- When school year ends, automatically set `graduation_date` = school year `end_date` for ALL existing 4th year students
- Set `is_graduated` = 1
- Set `status` = 'graduated'

**Where:** Lines 72-88

### 2. Fixed `archival_api.php`  
**What was added:**
- Use `COALESCE(s.graduation_date, ?)` to fallback to school year end date if student's graduation_date is NULL
- Auto-update students with missing graduation dates when checking archival eligibility

**Where:** Lines 197-212

## How to Apply the Fix to Existing Students

### Option 1: Run Auto-Advance Processor Manually
```
http://localhost/ibacmi/AdminAccount/auto_advance_processor.php
```
This will set graduation dates for existing 4th year students.

### Option 2: Run SQL Command Directly
```sql
UPDATE students 
SET graduation_date = '2025-10-19',
    is_graduated = 1,
    status = 'graduated'
WHERE year_level = 4
AND (graduation_date IS NULL OR is_graduated = 0);
```

### Option 3: Use Test Archival Page
1. Go to: `http://localhost/ibacmi/AdminAccount/test_archival.php`
2. Review the diagnostic information
3. The archival system will automatically fix graduation dates when you check for eligible students

## Verification Steps

1. **Check 4th year students have graduation dates:**
```sql
SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, year_level, 
       graduation_date, is_graduated, is_archived, status
FROM students 
WHERE year_level = 4;
```

Expected: `graduation_date` should be `2025-10-19`

2. **Check archival eligibility:**
- Go to Backup Management page
- Scroll to "Graduation-Based Archival"
- Check the statistics - should show 2 pending students
- Click "Run Automatic Archival"

3. **Verify archival completed:**
```sql
SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, is_archived
FROM students 
WHERE year_level = 4;
```

Expected: `is_archived` should be `1`

## What Changes Were Made

✅ **auto_advance_processor.php** - Added logic to set graduation_date for 4th year students when school year ends  
✅ **archival_api.php** - Added fallback logic and auto-fix for missing graduation dates  
❌ **No new files created**  
❌ **No existing features removed**  
❌ **No database schema changes**

## Impact
- **Backward compatible** - doesn't break existing functionality
- **Self-healing** - automatically fixes missing graduation dates when detected
- **Minimal changes** - only touched the essential logic needed to fix the issue
- **Future-proof** - will work correctly for all future school years

## Testing
After applying this fix, your 2 4th year students from school year 2025-2026 should:
1. Have `graduation_date` = 2025-10-19
2. Have `is_graduated` = 1  
3. Have `status` = 'graduated'
4. Be eligible for archival with "immediate" timing
5. Be archived when you run the automatic archival process
